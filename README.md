# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Implementation

## Project Description
This project implements the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipeline. RLHF leverages human preferences between pairs of agent-generated outputs to train a reward model. This learned reward model subsequently guides the training of a policy using reinforcement learning, aiming to align the agent's behavior more closely with human expectations than possible with hand-crafted reward functions alone.

## Algorithms Overview

### RLHF Pipeline
- **Type**: Reward Learning, Policy Optimization, Human-in-the-loop RL
- **Key Features**:
  - **Reward Modeling**: Trains a model to predict human preferences based on comparative data.
  - **Policy Optimization**: Uses a standard RL algorithm to optimize a policy against the learned reward model.
  - **Data Collection**: Involves gathering human feedback on agent outputs.
  - **Iterative Refinement**: Involves cycles of data collection, reward model training, and policy optimization.
